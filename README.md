# Read Me
This is a personal portfolio website mockup that I'm creating for myself as a graphic designer, and full stack web developer. This repository is intended to serve as a place to store my progress on my personal portfolio.

# Tech Stack

The tech stack for this project is always changing and evolving as I build out my personal portfolio. I will list all the languages and frameworks used in this project and edit the README.md whenever I add/remove certain languages.

### The tech is as follows:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* LESS.js http://lesscss.org/
* JQuery 2.2.4 https://code.jquery.com/ https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js (being used temporarily for the typing animation)

#### More tech will be added and removed as I see fit.
